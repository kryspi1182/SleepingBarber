# SleepingBarber
A solution to the sleeping barber problem, written in C (Ubuntu) using two mechanisms: condition variables and mutex-semaphore. 
The two solutions are almost identical. 

There are makefiles and executable files in the repo already.
Just to be sure, run a "make clean" and then "make".
The executables can either be run with no parameters, or with -debug for more info.
